## Introduction
Here we present the conceptual motivation, biology and technical equipment behind the \textit{Ushichka} dataset. The word Ushichka \textit{(OO-shi-ch-kaa)} $\foreignlanguage{russian}{Ушичка}$ in Bulgarian is the dimunitive for something with multiple ears. The name is chosen to highlight the fact that this is a  multichannel, multi-sensor dataset which aims to unobtrusively observe (listening with technological eyes and ears) bats echolocating in the wild in groups.
